==========================================
QUICK DEBUG: Photo Upload Error 500
==========================================

PHP Settings: ✅ ALREADY FIXED (10M, 300s)
But still error 500 with empty body

NEXT STEP: Test if PHP receives data at all

==========================================
ACTION 1: Upload Test File
==========================================

File: test-upload-simple.php
Upload to: public_html/backend-web/
Permissions: 644

This will show if PHP receives POST/FILES data.

==========================================
ACTION 2: Check Production Error Log
==========================================

cPanel → Metrics → Errors
Or: File Manager → error_log in backend-web/

Look for recent errors (last 5 minutes).

Possible errors:
- "Table 'photos' doesn't exist" → Files not uploaded
- "Column 'item_id' unknown" → Files not uploaded
- "No POST data" → PHP limits (but we fixed this)
- "Authorization required" → Auth issue

==========================================
ACTION 3: Upload Backend Files
==========================================

If error log shows table/column errors:

Upload these 7 files via cPanel File Manager:
1. classes/Visit.php
2. api/visit-photo-upload.php
3. api/visit-detail.php
4. api/visit-responses.php
5. api/improvement-recommendations.php
6. api/generate-recommendation-pdf.php
7. api/finding-photos.php

To: public_html/backend-web/
Permissions: 644

==========================================
QUICK TEST
==========================================

After uploading files, test photo upload again.

Expected:
✅ Status: 200
✅ Body: {"success":true,...}

If still 500:
→ Check error_log immediately
→ Copy error message
→ Send to me
